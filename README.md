# Social Media Mental Health Dashboard

# Introduction

The Social Media Mental Health Dashboard is an interactive web application that allows users to explore the relationship between social media and mental health. The data set used in this dashboard comes from Kaggle and provides visualizations in the form of bar charts, pie charts, and more. Additionally, there is demographic information provided for selected individuals. The relationship between social media usage and mental health has become a topic of significant interest and concern. As social media platforms continue to shape our daily lives and interactions with others, understanding their impact on mental health and well being is important. This project aims to investigate the impact of the duration and specific platforms of social media usage on various mental health outcomes, particularly in adolescents and young adults.
